# Log-In-Page
My simple log in page prompts user for username and password - 

Getting any of these wrong returns an error

Username identification takes preference, if not found will declare.
If username found, but password incorrect - code will declare.

Both correct will then port onto a new continuation page that hasn't been established yet
